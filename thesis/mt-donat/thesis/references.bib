	abstract = {There are currently very few practical methods for assessing the quality of resources or the reliability of other entities in the online environment. This makes it difﬁcult to make decisions about which resources can be relied upon and which entities it is safe to interact with. Trust and reputation systems are aimed at solving this problem by enabling service consumers to reliably assess the quality of services and the reliability of entities before they decide to use a particular service or to interact with or depend on a given entity. Such systems should also allow serious service providers and online players to correctly represent the reliability of themselves and the quality of their services. In the case of reputation systems, the basic idea is to let parties rate each other, for example after the completion of a transaction, and use the aggregated ratings about a given party to derive its reputation score. In the case of trust systems, the basic idea is to analyse and combine paths and networks of trust relationships in order to derive measures of trustworthiness of speciﬁc nodes. Reputation scores and trust measures can assist other parties in deciding whether or not to transact with a given party in the future, and whether it is safe to depend on a given resource or entity. This represents an incentive for good behaviour and for offering reliable resources, which thereby tends to have a positive effect on the quality of online markets and communities. This chapter describes the background, current status and future trend of online trust and reputation systems.},

	abstract = {Crossroads are the main trafﬁc jam generators in densely populated cities. Unmanned vehicles and intelligent transportation systems can signiﬁcantly reduce congestion and improve road safety by eliminating the main cause of trafﬁc accidents—the human factor. However, full conﬁdence in their safety is necessary. This paper addresses the contextual data integrity problem, when an unmanned autonomous vehicle transmits incorrect data due to technical problems, or malicious attacks. We propose an approach based on trust and reputation that allows detecting vehicles transmitting bogus data. To verify the feasibility of the approach on practice, we conducted both software and physical simulations using the model of intersection and unmanned autonomous vehicle models. The simulation results show that the approach applied allows detecting vehicles with bogus data and excluding them from the group, thus increasing the safety of the intersection traversal by other vehicles.},

	abstract = {Trust networks consist of transitive trust relationships between people, organisations and software agents connected through a medium for communication and interaction. By formalising trust relationships, e.g. as reputation scores or as subjective trust measures, trust between parties within the community can be derived by analysing the trust paths linking the parties together. This article describes a method for trust network analysis using subjective logic (TNA-SL). It provides a simple notation for expressing transitive trust relationships, and deﬁnes a method for simplifying complex trust networks so that they can be expressed in a concise form and be computationally analysed. Trust measures are expressed as beliefs, and subjective logic is used to compute trust between arbitrary parties in the network. We show that TNA-SL is efﬁcient, and illustrate possible applications with examples.},

	abstract = {Reputation management (RM) is employed in distributed and peer-to-peer networks to help users compute a measure of trust in other users based on initial belief, observed behavior, and run-time feedback. These trust values influence how, or with whom, a user will interact. Existing literature on RM focuses primarily on algorithm development, not comparative analysis. To remedy this, we propose an evaluation framework based on the trace-simulator paradigm. Trace file generation emulates a variety of network configurations, and particular attention is given to modeling malicious user behavior. Simulation is trace-based and incremental trust calculation techniques are developed to allow experimentation with networks of substantial size. The described framework is available as open source so that researchers can evaluate the effectiveness of other reputation management techniques and/or extend functionality.},

	abstract = {Representing, manipulating, and inferring trust from the user point of view certainly is a grand challenge in virtual worlds, including online games. When someone meets an unknown individual, the question is “Can I trust him/her or not?” This requires the user to have access to a representation of trust about others, as well as a set of operators to undertake inference about the trustability of other users/players. In this paper, we employ a trust representation generated from in-world data in order to feed individual trust decisions. To achieve that purpose, we assume that such a representation of trust already exists; in fact, it was proposed in another paper of ours. Thus, the focus here is on the trust mechanisms required to infer trustability of other users/players. More speciﬁcally, we use an individual trust representation deployed as a trust network as base to the inference mechanism that employs two subjective logic operators (consensus and discount) to automatically derive trust decisions. The proposed trust inference system has been validated through OpenSimulator scenarios, which has led to a 5\% increase on trustability of avatars in relation to the reference scenario (without trust).},

	abstract = {In virtual worlds (including computer games), users develop trust relationships from their in-world interactions with others. However, these trust relationships end up not being represented in the data structures (or databases) of such virtual worlds, though they sometimes appear associated with reputation and recommendation systems. In addition, as far as we know, the user is not provided with a personal trust tool to sustain his/her decision-making while he/she interacts with other users in the virtual or game world. In order to come up with a computational formal representation of these personal trust relationships, we need to succeed in converting in-world interactions into reliable sources of trust-related data. In this paper, we develop the required formalisms to gather and represent in-world interactions—which are based on the activity theory—as well as a method to convert in-world interactions into trust networks. In the companion paper, we use these trust networks to produce a computational trust decision based on subjective logic. This solution aims at supporting in-world user (or avatar) decisions about others in the game world.

Individuals and organizations have utilized these environments for performing transactions, sharing information, and engaging in collaboration. However, the benefits that digital environments offer also attract a number of dishonest entities. These entities perform malicious activities that further disadvantage other genuine entities.

Such method should allow entities to gauge the trustworthiness of other entities. Therefore, this method could increase the confidence of the entities to perform the transaction or collaboration.

	abstract = {Models of computational trust support users in taking decisions. They are commonly used to guide users’ judgements in online auction sites; or to determine quality of contributions in Web 2.0 sites. However, most existing systems require historical information about the past behavior of the speciﬁc agent being judged. In contrast, in real life, to anticipate and to predict a stranger’s actions in absence of the knowledge of such behavioral history, we often use our “instinct”—essentially stereotypes developed from our past interactions with other “similar” persons. In this paper, we propose StereoTrust, a computational trust model inspired by stereotypes as used in real-life. A stereotype contains certain features of agents and an expected outcome of the transaction. When facing a stranger, an agent derives its trust by aggregating stereotypes matching the stranger’s proﬁle. Since stereotypes are formed locally, recommendations stem from the trustor’s own personal experiences and perspective. Historical behavioral information, when available, can be used to reﬁne the analysis. According to our experiments using Epinions.com dataset, StereoTrust compares favorably with existing trust models that use different kinds of information and more complete historical information.},

This testbed serves in two roles: (1) as a competition forum in which researchers can compare their technologies against objective metrics, and (2) as a suite of tools with ﬂexible parameters, allowing researchers to perform customizable, easily-repeatable experiments. This paper ﬁrst enumerates trust research objectives to be addressed in the testbed and desirable testbed characteristics, then presents a competition testbed speciﬁcation that is justiﬁed according to these requirements.

They have been proposed in several domains and many advances in trust formation have been made recently. The question of comparing trust models, however, is still without a clear answer. Traditionally, authors set up ad hoc experiments and present evaluation results that are difﬁcult to compare – sometimes even interpret – in the context of other trust models. As a solution, the community came up with common evaluation platforms, called trust testbeds. In this paper we expose shortcomings of evaluation models that existing testbeds use; they evaluate trust models by combining them with some ad hoc decision making mechanism and then evaluate the quality of trust-based decisions. They assume that if all trust models use the same decision making mechanism, the mechanism itself becomes irrelevant for the evaluation. We hypothesized that the choice of decision making mechanism is in fact relevant. To test our claim we built a testbed, called Alpha testbed, that can evaluate trust models either with or without decision making mechanism. With it we evaluated ﬁve well-known trust models using two different decision making mechanisms. The results conﬁrm our hypothesis; the choice of decision making mechanisms inﬂuences the performance of trust models. Based on our ﬁndings, we recommend to evaluate trust models independently of the decision making mechanism – and we also provide a method (and a tool) to do so.},

	title = {{EStarMom}: {Extendable} {Simulator} for {Trust} and {Reputation} {Management} in {Online} {Marketplaces}},
	abstract = {Trust and Reputation Systems (TRSs), practically known as feedback or rating systems, are an indispensable part of any online community framework in general and of any emarketplace in particular. The key functionalities of these systems in an e-marketplace are clear, which are building trust among strangers and keeping track of the participants’ behavior. However, the question of how to evaluate and compare these TRSs to each other is still unclear. A simulation method is chosen in this paper to address this question. This is the main motivation for the development of a Java-based simulator EStarMom (Extendable Simulator for Trust And Reputation Management in Online Marketplaces). The simulator is tailor-made for emarketplace environments by extendable libraries of buying and selling behavioral models, trust algorithms, and buyers’ decision-making models. Along with the simulator, a set of metrics to measure the performance of the TRSs are proposed and implemented, including individualbased and community-based metrics. The individual-based metrics are designed based on the game theory mindset assuming that the market participants, including buyers and sellers, are self-interested. The buyers care about their satisfaction in each buying transaction, the sellers are interested in making proﬁt and increasing market share. On the other hand, the community-based metrics are proposed based on the market operator’s concerns which are Pareto eﬃciency in allocating “resources”. For the buyers, “resources” are the good sellers with quality products. For the sellers, “resources” are the demands from the buyers. EStarMom can be used to investigate the performance of a trust algorithm under a certain composition of the market participants, especially in the presence of attacks or misbehaviors, hence the quantitative insights into the robustness of the algorithm in coping with misbehaviors are gained. When trust algorithms are measured under the same simulation settings, their measurements are comparable. EStarMom is free and open-source, and will be released under the CeCILL license at the address here.},

In the coming decades, we will be surrounded by billions of sensors, devices, and machines, the Internet of Things (IoT). As the world becomes more connected, we will become dependent on machines and simulation to make decisions on our behalf. When simulation systems use data from sensors, devices and machines (i.e., things) to make decisions, they need to learn how to trust that data, as well as the things they are interacting with. As embedded simulation becomes more commonplace in IoT and smart city applications, it is essential that decision makers are able to trust the simulation systems making decisions on their behalf. This paper looks at trust from an IoT perspective, describing a set of research projects conducted that span multiple dimensions of trust, and discusses whether these concepts of trust apply to simulation.},

Additionally, trust and reputation have been recognized as key issues in online markets and many researchers have, in different perspectives, surveyed the related notions, mechanisms and models. Within the context of this work we present an adaptable, multivariate agent testbed for the simulation of open online markets and the study of various factors affecting the quality of the service consumed. This testbed, which we call Euphemus, is highly parameterized and can be easily customized to suit a particular application domain. It allows for building various market scenarios and analyzing interesting properties of e-commerce environments from a trust perspective. The architecture of Euphemus is presented and a number of well-known trust and reputation models are built with Euphemus, in order to show how the testbed can be used to apply and adapt models. Extensive experimentation has been performed in order to show how models behave in unreliable online markets, results are discussed and interesting conclusions are drawn.},

	abstract = {The visible success of the Peer to Peer (P2P) paradigm is associated with many challenges in ﬁnding trustworthy peers as reliable communication partners. Reputation management systems are emerging in the face of these challenges. The EigenTrust reputation management system is among the most known and successful reputation systems. On the other hand, a main drawback of this system is its reliance on a set of pre-trusted peers which causes nodes to center around them. As a consequence, other peers are ranked low despite being honest, marginalizing their effect in the system. To tackle this problem, this paper proposed enhancing the EigenTrust algorithm by giving peers with high reputation values (honest peers) a role in calculating the global reputation of other peers. Rather than solely depending on the static group of pre-trusted peers, the proposed algorithm, HonestPeer, selects the most reputable nodes, honest peers, dynamically based on the quality of the provided ﬁles. This makes HonestPeer more robust to the increase in the number of ﬁles and nodes in the system. Through simulation, it has been shown that HonestPeer has successfully maintained higher success rate and lower percentage of inauthentic downloads when compared to the original algorithm.},

For many of these kinds of attacks detection is unfeasible, thus making it hard to produce security. Despite their characterization as dynamically reconﬁgurable networks, it is nonetheless essential to identify topology and population properties that can optimise mitigation protocols’ deployment. In this paper, we provide an algorithmic deﬁnition and simulation of a trust and mitigation based protocol to contain a Black Hole style attack on a VANET. We experimentally show its optimal working conditions: total connectivity, followed by a random network; connection to external networks; early deployment of the protocol and ranking of the message. We compare results with those of existing protocols and future work shall focus on repeated broadcasting, opportunistic message forwarding and testing on real data.},

A multitude of trust and reputation systems have been proposed to try to cope with the problem of cheating. These systems are often evaluated by measuring their performance against simple agents that cheat randomly. Unfortunately, these systems are not often evaluated from the perspective of security—can a motivated attacker defeat the protection? Previously, it was argued that existing systems may suffer from vulnerabilities that permit effective, proﬁtable cheating despite the use of the system. In this work, we experimentally substantiate the presence of these vulnerabilities by successfully implementing and testing a number of such ‘attacks’, which consist only of sequences of sales (honest and dishonest) that can be executed in the system. This investigation also reveals two new, previously-unnoted cheating techniques. Our success in executing these attacks compellingly makes a key point: security must be a central design goal for developers of trust and reputation systems.},

However, trust and reputation systems will only be able to produce this effect when they are sufﬁciently robust against strategic manipulation or direct attacks. Currently, robustness analysis of TRSs is mostly done through simple simulated scenarios implemented by the TRS designers themselves, and this can not be considered as reliable evidence for how these systems would perform in a realistic environment. In order to set robustness requirements it is important to know how important robustness really is in a particular community or market.

In this article, we propose UASTrustChain, a trust management framework based on Blockchain time-stamped series. We consider a system of models, consists of a number of autonomous UAVs, whose behaviors are regularly monitored by a set of distributed observers (DOs). Since most cyber attacks cause interruption in the operations of UAVs or deviation from their original path, the DOs keep track of the UAVs’ behavior in terms of their trajectory, as well as the number of their successful tasks. The DOs calculate a relative trust score for each UAV and keep these scores in a transparent, reliable, secure and open ledger. This framework can detect UAVs’ abnormal behavior in a real-time manner further to detect the compromised distributed observers, if any. The proposed framework could also distinguish abnormal activities due to real attacks from those caused by harsh environmental conditions. We evaluate the proposed framework for its functionality and accuracy by performing extensive simulation experiments. Our simulation results show that the proposed trust model can detect compromised distributed observers and fades their effect on the UAVs trust scores. Results further show the ability of the system in detecting malicious UAVs, which can be under various cyber-physical attacks.},

The attacker can use compromised sensor nodes to disrupt communications or inject misleading sensor values. Misleading data can corrupt the entire decision making process, which depends upon WSN data. We propose a trust mechanism, which evaluates communication trust and data trust for WSNs. Communication trust is computed from direct and indirect observations of the neighbour’s forwarding behavior. Direct trust is derived from the consistency of forwarding behavior. Indirect trust is derived from the neighbour’s observations translated into recommendations. We use weighted Dempster–Shaffer (D–S) theory to compute indirect trust. Data trust is computed by using median of sensor data. We present arguments and simulation results to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm against packet forwarding/modiﬁcation attacks, bad mouthing attacks, collusion attacks, and on–off attacks.

	abstract = {Vehicular ad hoc network (VANET), a novel technology, holds a paramount importance within the transportation domain due to its abilities to increase trafﬁc efﬁciency and safety. Connected vehicles propagate sensitive information which must be shared with the neighbors in a secure environment. However, VANET may also include dishonest nodes such as manin-the-middle (MiTM) attackers aiming to distribute and share malicious content with the vehicles, thus polluting the network with compromised information. In this regard, establishing trust among connected vehicles can increase security as every participating vehicle will generate and propagate authentic, accurate, and trusted content within the network. In this article, we propose a novel trust model, namely, MiTM attack resistance trust model in connected vehicles (MARINE), which identiﬁes dishonest nodes performing MiTM attacks in an efﬁcient way as well as revokes their credentials. Every node running MARINE system ﬁrst establishes trust for the sender by performing multidimensional plausibility checks. Once the receiver veriﬁes the trustworthiness of the sender, the received data are then evaluated both directly and indirectly. Extensive simulations are carried out to evaluate the performance and accuracy of MARINE rigorously across three MiTM attacker models and the benchmarked trust model. The simulation results show that for a network containing 35\% of MiTM attackers, MARINE outperforms the state-of-the-art trust model by 15\%, 18\%, and 17\% improvements in precision, recall, and F-score, respectively.},

	abstract = {Ratings (also known as recommendations) provide an efﬁcient and effective way to build trust relationship in the human society, by making use of the information from others rather than exclusively relying on one’s own direct observations. However, it is uncertain that whether the rating can play the same positive effect in the open computing environment because of differences between the computing world and human society. We envisage that there are two kinds of uncertainties: the uncertainty resulting from rating aggregation algorithms and the uncertainty resulting from other algorithm-independent design factors, which are coined as algorithm uncertainty and factor uncertainty in this paper. The algorithm uncertainty is related to such a problem: are the complex aggregating algorithms necessary? The factor uncertainty refers to how the performance of ratings is affected by all kinds of factors, including trust model design related factors and trust model design independent factors. In this paper, we take an initial step to answer these two uncertainties. First, we study the effect of all factors based on a simple averaging rating algorithm in terms of several proposed performance metrics. Then we compare different rating aggregation algorithms in the same context and platform, focusing on several relevant metrics. The simulation results show that ratings are not always as helpful as what we expected, especially when the system is facing malicious raters and highly dynamic peer behaviors. In certain circumstances, the simple average aggregation algorithm performs better than the complex ones, especially when there are considerable number of bad raters in the system. Considering the system dynamics, the cost of the algorithm design, and the system overhead, we argue that it is not worth putting too much energy on the design of complex rating aggregation schemes for trust inference in open computing environments.},

A reputation system encourages the honest behaviour of seller agents and discourages the malicious behaviour of dishonest seller agents in the e-market where actual traders never meet each other. This paper evaluates various reputation systems for assigning reputation rating to software agents acting on behalf of buyers and sellers in e-market. These models are analysed on the basis of a number of features viz. reputation computation and their defence mechanisms against different attacks. To address the problems of traditional reputation systems which are relatively static in nature, this paper identifies characteristics of a dynamic reputation framework which ensures judicious use of information sharing for inter-agent cooperation and also associates the reputation of an agent with the value of a transaction so that the market approaches an equilibrium state and dishonest agents are weeded out of the market.},

In this work, we aim to foster reuse in respect of trust and reputation systems by providing a hierarchical component taxonomy of computation engines which serves as a natural framework for the design of new reputation systems. In order to assist the design process we, furthermore, provide a component repository that contains design knowledge on both a conceptual and an implementation level. To evaluate our approach we conduct a descriptive scenario-based analysis which shows that it has an obvious utility from a practical point of view. Matching the identified components and the properties of trust introduced in literature, we finally show which properties of trust are widely covered by common models and which aspects have only rarely been considered so far.},

	abstract = {The purpose of a reputation system is to hold the users of a distributed application accountable for their behavior. The reputation of a user is computed as an aggregate of the feedback provided by fellow users in the system. Truthful feedback is clearly a prerequisite for computing a reputation score that accurately represents the behavior of a user. However, it has been observed that users can hesitate in providing truthful feedback, for example, due to the fear of retaliation. Privacy preserving reputation systems enable users to provide feedback in a private and thus uninhibited manner. In this survey, we propose analysis frameworks for privacy preserving reputation systems. We use these analysis frameworks to review and compare the existing systems in the literature. An emphasis is placed on blockchain-based systems as they are a recent signiﬁcant development in the area. Utilizing blockchain as a building block, privacy preserving reputation systems have been able to provide properties such as trustlessness, transparency, and immutability, which were absent from prior systems. The results of the analysis reveal several insights and directions for future research. These include exploiting blockchain to its full potential to develop truly trustless systems and to implement some important security properties and defenses against common attacks that are so far ignored by a majority of the systems.},

	abstract = {Internet of things (IoT) is a contemporary technology, which links a tremendous number of devices with each other to ease the life via many useful services such as information exchange, monitoring, and control. IoT comprises different types of entities such as sensors and RFID tags, which mostly deployed in unattended, sensitive, and hostile territories. Due to rapid scalability and high heterogeneity, traditional security approaches fails to provide adequate security mechanisms for the current IoT infrastructure. The possibility of insecure and unattended deployment make some of IoT's entities subject to be captured physically by the attackers. As a result, the victim device can be exploited as a gateway to compromise the entire network. Furthermore, an entity may not work correctly because of resources constraints or instability of network's link. Recently, trust and reputation (TR) extended in IoT to monitor the behaviors deviation of IoT entities. Many TR models introduced, to incorporate the trust concepts in IoT as a new security paradigm. In this study, we provide thematic taxonomy for trust in IoT, considering several issues such as understanding of trust entity roles, trust properties, trust applications, levels of trust management, trust metrics, trust computation schemes and attacks on TR. Finally, the survey presents advances and open research challenges in the IoT's trust.},

The basic idea is to let parties rate each other, for example after the completion of a transaction, and use the aggregated ratings about a given party to derive a trust or reputation score, which can assist other parties in deciding whether or not to transact with that party in the future. A natural side effect is that it also provides an incentive for good behaviour, and therefore tends to have a positive effect on market quality. Reputation systems can be called collaborative sanctioning systems to reﬂect their collaborative nature, and are related to collaborative ﬁltering systems. Reputation systems are already being used in successful commercial online applications. There is also a rapidly growing literature around trust and reputation systems, but unfortunately this activity is not very coherent. The purpose of this article is to give an overview of existing and proposed systems that can be used to derive measures of trust and reputation for Internet transactions, to analyse the current trends and developments in this area, and to propose a research agenda for trust and reputation systems.},

	abstract = {Web service recommendation systems can help service users to locate the right service from the large number of available web services. Avoiding recommending dishonest or unsatisfactory services is a fundamental research problem in the design of web service recommendation systems. Reputation of web services is a widely-employed metric that determines whether the service should be recommended to a user. The service reputation score is usually calculated using feedback ratings provided by users. Although the reputation measurement of web service has been studied in the recent literature, existing malicious and subjective user feedback ratings often lead to a bias that degrades the performance of the service recommendation system. In this paper, we propose a novel reputation measurement approach for web service recommendations. We ﬁrst detect malicious feedback ratings by adopting the cumulative sum control chart, and then we reduce the effect of subjective user feedback preferences employing the Pearson Correlation Coefﬁcient. Moreover, in order to defend malicious feedback ratings, we propose a malicious feedback rating prevention scheme employing Bloom ﬁltering to enhance the recommendation performance. Extensive experiments are conducted by employing a real feedback rating data set with 1.5 million web service invocation records. The experimental results show that our proposed measurement approach can reduce the deviation of the reputation measurement and enhance the success ratio of the web service recommendation.},

Nonetheless online reputation system is not immune from attack. Dealing with malicious ratings in reputation systems has been recognized as an important but difﬁcult task. This problem is challenging when the number of true user’s ratings is relatively small and unfair ratings plays majority in rated values. In this paper, we have proposed a new method to ﬁnd malicious users in online reputation systems using Quality Repository Approach (QRA). We mainly concentrated on anomaly detection in both rating values and the malicious users. QRA is very efﬁcient to detect malicious user ratings and aggregate true ratings. The proposed reputation system has been evaluated through simulations and it is concluded that the QRA based system signiﬁcantly reduces the impact of unfair ratings and improve trust on reputation score with lower false positive as compared to other method used for the purpose.},

	abstract = {With the increasing popularity of online shopping markets, a significant number of consumers rely on these venues to meet their demands while choosing different products based on the ratings provided by others. Simultaneously, consumers feel confident in expressing their opinions through ratings. As a result, millions of ratings are generated on the web for different products, services, and dealers. Nonetheless, a noticeable number of users post unfair feedback. Recent studies have shown that reputation escalation is emerging as a new service, by which dealers pay to receive good feedback and escalate their ratings in online shopping markets. Therefore, finding robust and reliable ways to distinguish between fake and trustworthy ratings from users is a crucial task for every online shopping market. Moreover, with the dramatic increase in the number of ratings provided by consumers, scalability has arisen as another significant issue in the existing methods of reputation systems. To tackle these issues, we propose a randomized algorithm that calculates the reputation based on a random sample of the ratings. Since the randomly selected sample has a logarithmic size, it guarantees feasible scalability for large-scale online review systems. In addition, the randomness nature of the algorithm makes it robust against unfair ratings. We provide a thorough theoretical analysis of the proposed algorithm and validate its effectiveness through extensive empirical evaluation using real-world and synthetically generated datasets. Our experimental results show that the proposed method provides a high accuracy while running much faster than the existing iterative filtering approaches.},

	abstract = {Some misbehavior detection and reputation systems in mobile ad-hoc networks rely on the dissemination of information of observed behavior, which makes them vulnerable to false accusations. This vulnerability could be removed by forbidding the dissemination of information on observed behavior in the ﬁrst place, but, as we show here, this has more drawbacks than a solution that allows dissemination and copes with false accusations. We propose a method for reducing the impact of false accusations. In our approach, nodes collect ﬁrst-hand information about the behavior of other nodes by direct observation. In addition, nodes maintain a rating about every other node that they care about, in the form of a continuous variable per node. From time to time nodes exchange their ﬁrst-hand information with others, but, using the Bayesian approach we designed and present in this paper, only second-hand information that is not incompatible with the current rating is accepted. Ratings are slightly modiﬁed by accepted information. The reputation of a given node is the collection of ratings maintained by others about this node. By means of simulation we evaluated the robustness of our approach against several types of adversaries that spread false information, and its eﬃciency at detecting malicious nodes. The simulation results indicate that our system largely reduces the impact of false accusations, while still beneﬁting from the accelerated detection of malicious nodes provided by second-hand information. We also found that when information dissemination is not used, the time until malicious nodes are detected can be unacceptable.},

We conduct an in-depth investigation on this new attack, including analysis, case study, and performance evaluation based on real data and realistic user behavior models. We discover that the RepTrap is a strong and destructive attack that can manipulate the reputation scores of users, objects, and even undermine the entire reputation system.

	abstract = {Objectives: People often hold unduly positive expectations about the outcomes of medicines and other healthcare products. Here the following explanation is tested: people who have a positive outcome tend to tell more people about their disease/treatment than people with poor or average outcomes. Akin to the file drawer problem in science, this systematically and positively distorts the information available to others.
Method: If people with good treatment outcomes are more inclined to tell others, then they should also be more inclined to write online medical product reviews. Therefore, average outcomes in these reviews should be more positive than those found in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Data on duration of treatment and outcome (i.e., weight / cholesterol change) were extracted from user-generated health product reviews on Amazon.com and compared to RCT data for the same treatments using ANOVA. The sample included 1,675 reviews of cholesterol reduction (Benecol, CholestOff) and weight loss (Orlistat) treatments and the primary outcome was cholesterol change (Bencol and CholestOff) or weight change (Orlistat).
Result: In three independent tests, average outcomes reported in the reviews were substantially more positive than the outcomes reported in the medical literature (������2 = .01 to 0.06; p = .04 to .001). For example, average cholesterol change following use of Benecol is -14mg/dl in RCTs and -45mg/dl in online reviews.
Conclusions: People with good treatment outcomes are more inclined to share information about their treatment, which distorts the information available to others. People who rely on word of mouth reputation, electronic or real life, are likely to develop unduly positive expectations.},

We explain this as a consequence of self-selection, where reviewers are drawn disproportionately from the subset of potential consumers favorably predisposed toward the resource. Inflated ratings tend to attract consumers with lower expected value, who have a greater chance of disappointment. Paradoxically, the more accurate the ratings, the greater the degree of self-selection, and the faster the ratings become biased. We derive sufficient conditions under which biased ratings occur. Finally, we outline a potential solution to this problem that involves stating expectations before interaction with the resource, and expressing subsequent ratings in terms of delight or disappointment.},

As trust is a subjective notion that is invisible, implicit and uncertain in nature, many attempts have been made to model trust with aid of Bayesian probability theory, while the ﬁeld lacks a global comprehensive analysis for variants of Bayesian trust models. We present a study to ﬁll in this gap by giving a comprehensive review of the literature. A generic Bayesian trust (GBT) modeling perspective is highlighted here. It is shown that all models under survey can cast into a GBT based computing paradigm as special cases. We discuss both capabilities and limitations of the GBT perspective and point out open questions to answer, with a hope to advance GBT to become a pragmatic infrastructure for analyzing intrinsic relationships among variants of trust models and developing novel tools for trust evaluation.},

This assumption depends on two factors, primarily that trust and reputation scores faithfully reﬂect past observed quality, and secondly that future quality will be truly similar to that represented by the scores. Unfortunately, poor robustness of trust and reputation systems often makes it relatively easy to manipulate these factors, so that the fundamental assumption behind trust and reputation systems becomes questionable.

The basic idea is to have a mechanism for rating services on various aspects, and a way of computing reputation scores based on the ratings from many different parties. By making the reputation scores public, such systems can assist parties in deciding whether or not to use a particular service. Reputation systems represent soft security mechanisms for social control. This article presents a type of reputation system based on the Dirichlet probability distribution which is a multinomial Bayesian probability distribution. Dirichlet reputation systems represent a generalisation of the binomial Beta reputation system. The multinomial aspect of Dirichlet reputation systems means that any set of discrete rating levels can be deﬁned. This provides great ﬂexibility and usability, as well as a sound basis for designing reputation systems.},

	abstract = {In many dynamic open systems, autonomous agents must interact with one another to achieve their goals. Such agents may be self-interested and, when trusted to perform an action, may betray that trust by not performing the action as required. Due to the scale and dynamism of these systems, agents will often need to interact with other agents with which they have little or no past experience. Each agent must therefore be capable of assessing and identifying reliable interaction partners, even if it has no personal experience with them. To this end, we present HABIT, a Hierarchical And Bayesian Inferred Trust model for assessing how much an agent should trust its peers based on direct and third party information. This model is robust in environments in which third party information is malicious, noisy, or otherwise inaccurate. Although existing approaches claim to achieve this, most rely on heuristics with little theoretical foundation. In contrast, HABIT is based exclusively on principled statistical techniques: it can cope with multiple discrete or continuous aspects of trustee behaviour; it does not restrict agents to using a single shared representation of behaviour; it can improve assessment by using any observed correlation between the behaviour of similar trustees or information sources; and it provides a pragmatic solution to the whitewasher problem (in which unreliable agents assume a new identity to avoid bad reputation). In this paper, we describe the theoretical aspects of HABIT, and present experimental results that demonstrate its ability to predict agent behaviour in both a simulated environment, and one based on data from a real-world webserver domain. In particular, these experiments show that HABIT can predict trustee performance based on multiple representations of behaviour, and is up to twice as accurate as BLADE, an existing state-of-the-art trust model that is both statistically principled and has been previously shown to outperform a number of other probabilistic trust models.},

In this work, we classify the existing trust models into two broad categories and propose an extendable e-marketplace testbed to evaluate their robustness against diﬀerent unfair rating attacks comprehensively. On top of highlighting the robustness of the existing trust models for handling unfair ratings is far from what they were claimed to be, we further propose and validate a novel combination mechanism for the existing trust models, Discount-then-Filter, to notably enhance their robustness against the investigated attacks.},

This problem is challenging especially when the number of honest ratings is relatively small and unfair ratings can contribute to a signiﬁcant portion of the overall ratings. In addition, the lack of unfair rating data from real human users is another obstacle toward realistic evaluation of defense mechanisms. In this paper, we propose a set of methods that jointly detect smart and collaborative unfair ratings based on signal modeling. Based on the detection, a framework of trust-assisted rating aggregation system is developed. Furthermore, we design and launch a Rating Challenge to collect unfair rating data from real human users. The proposed system is evaluated through simulations as well as experiments using real attack data.

When there are no mechanisms in place to detect collusion and deception, combining user testimonies as such to form a provider’s reputation may not give an accurate assessment, especially if the context of the ratings is not known. Moreover, such systems are vulnerable to manipulations by malicious users. Hence it becomes essential to establish the validity of the ratings prior to using them in formulating reputation based on such ratings. It is important to identify the rationale behind the ratings so that similar ratings (or ratings pertaining to a context) can be aggregated to obtain a reputation value meaningful in that context. We propose a fuzzy approach to analyze user rating behavior to infer the rationale for ratings in a web services environment. This inference of rationale facilitates the system to validate ratings, detect deception and collusion, identify user preferences and provide recommendations to users.},

	abstract = {In multiagent systems populated by self-interested agents, consumer agents would beneﬁt by modeling the reputation of provider agents, in order to make effective decisions about which agents to trust. One method for representing reputation is to ask other agents in the system (called advisor agents) to provide ratings of the provider agents. The problem of unfair ratings exists in almost every reputation system, including both unfairly high and unfairly low ratings. We begin by surveying some existing approaches to this problem, characterizing their capabilities and categorizing them in terms of two main dimensions: public-private and global-local. The impact of reputation system architectures on approach selection is also discussed. Based on the study, we propose a novel personalized approach for effectively handling unfair ratings in an enhanced centralized reputation system. Experimental results demonstrate that the approach effectively adjusts the trustworthiness of advisor agents according to the percentages of unfair ratings provided by them. We then argue for the merits of our model as the basis for designing social networks to share reputation ratings of providers in multiagent systems.},

They would behave in such a way so as to achieve their own objectives, even at the cost of others. Therefore, there are risks in interacting with other agents. A number of computational trust models have been proposed to manage such risk. However, the performance of most computational trust models that rely on third-party recommendations as part of the mechanism to derive trust is easily deteriorated by the presence of unfair testimonies. There have been several attempts to combat the inﬂuence of unfair testimonies. Nevertheless, they are either not readily applicable since they require additional information which is not available in realistic settings, or ad-hoc as they are tightly coupled with speciﬁc trust models. Against this background, a general credibility model is proposed in this paper. Empirical studies have shown that the proposed credibility model is more effective than related work in mitigating the adverse inﬂuence of unfair testimonies.},

This paper proposes a defense mechanism for filtering out dishonest recommendations based on a measure of dissimilarity function between the two subsets. A subset of recommendations with the highest measure of dissimilarity is considered as a set of dishonest recommendations. To analyze the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we have simulated three inherent attack scenarios for recommendation models (bad mouthing, ballot stuffing, and random opinion attack). The simulation results show that the proposed approach can effectively filter out the dishonest recommendations based on the majority rule.

However, in such open and dynamic environments, these reports can be inaccurate because of the differing views of the reporters. Moreover, due to the conﬂicting interests that stem from the multiple stakeholders, some witnesses may deliberately provide false information to serve their own interests. Now, in either case, if such inaccuracy is not recognised and dealt with, it will adversely affect the function of the reputation model. To this end, this paper presents a generic method that detects inaccuracy in witness reports and updates the witness’s credibility accordingly so that less credence is placed on its future reports. Our method is empirically evaluated and is shown to help agents effectively detect inaccurate witness reports in a variety of scenarios where various degrees of inaccuracy in witness reports are introduced.},

However, relying on the mean value presumes that the users’ marking practices remain constant over time; in practice though, it is possible that a user’s marking practices change over time, i.e. a user could start as strict and subsequently become lenient, or vice versa. In this work, we propose an approach to take into account marking practices shifts by (1) introducing the concept of dynamic user rating averages which follow the users’ marking practices shifts, (2) presenting two alternative algorithms for computing a user’s dynamic averages and (3) performing a comparative evaluation among these two algorithms and the classic static average (unique mean value) that the Pearson Correlation uses.},

	abstract = {Trust is essential to economic efficiency. Trading partners choose each other and make decisions based on how much they trust one another. The way to assess trust in e-commerce is different from those in brick and mortar businesses, as there are limited indicators available in online environments. One way is to deploy trust and reputation management systems that are based on collecting feedbacks about partners’ transactions. One of the problems within such systems is the presence of unfair ratings. In this paper, an innovative QADE trust model is presented, which assumes the existence of unfairly reported trust assessments. Subjective nature of trust is considered, where differently reported trust values do not necessarily mean false trust values but can also imply differences in dispositions to trust. The method to identify and filter out the presumably false values is defined. In our method, a trust evaluator finds other agents in society that are similar to him, taking into account pairwise similarity of trust values and similarity of agents’ general mindsets. In order to reduce the effect of unfair ratings, the values reported by the non-similar agents are excluded from the trust computation. Simulations have been used to compare the effectiveness of algorithms to decrease the effect of unfair ratings. The simulations have been carried out in environments with varying number of attackers and targeted agents, as well as with different kinds of attackers. The results showed significant improvements of our proposed method. On average 6\% to 13\% more unfair trust ratings have been detected by our method. Unfair rating effects on trust assessment were reduced with average improvements from 26\% to 57\% compared to the other most effective filtering methods by Whitby and Teacy.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to propose a solution to an extremely pertinent problem, namely, that of identifying unreliable sensors (in a domain of reliable and unreliable ones) without any knowledge of the ground truth. This fascinating paradox can be formulated in simple terms as trying to identify stochastic liars without any additional information about the truth. Though apparently impossible, we will show that it is feasible to solve the problem, a claim that is counterintuitive in and of itself. One aspect of our contribution is to show how redundancy can be introduced, and how it can be effectively utilized in resolving this paradox. Legacy work and the reported literature (for example, in the so-called weighted majority algorithm) have merely addressed assessing the reliability of a sensor by comparing its reading to the ground truth either in an online or an ofﬂine manner. Unfortunately, the fundamental assumption of revealing the ground truth cannot be always guaranteed (or even expected) in many real life scenarios. While some extensions of the Condorcet jury theorem [9] can lead to a probabilistic guarantee on the quality of the fused process, they do not provide a solution to the unreliable sensor identiﬁcation problem. The essence of our approach involves studying the agreement of each sensor with the rest of the sensors, and not comparing the reading of the individual sensors with the ground truth—as advocated in the literature. Under some mild conditions on the reliability of the sensors, we can prove that we can, indeed, ﬁlter out the unreliable ones. Our approach leverages the power of the theory of learning automata (LA) so as to gradually learn the identity of the reliable and unreliable sensors. To achieve this, we resort to a team of LA, where a distinct automaton is associated with each sensor. The solution provided here has been subjected to rigorous experimental tests, and the results presented are, in our opinion, both novel and conclusive.},

	abstract = {Online reputation has a strong impact on the success of a seller in an e-marketplace. Also, buyers use it to choose an appropriate seller among a set of alternatives. The standard practice of determining the reputation of a seller is the aggregation of the feedbacks or the ratings reported by its buyers. Such a model of reputation formulation is vulnerable to misleading and unfair feedbacks. A seller may collude with a set of buyers to report good feedbacks while the quality of its product is poor. Also the buyers can report unfair feedbacks being irrational, malicious or competitors. A robust reputation management mechanism is the one which can not be manipulated by these unfair feedbacks. The existing reputation management models are either reactive or proactive. The reactive solutions intend to identify the unfair feedbacks and the proactive solutions propose incentive to the buyers to encourage them to report fair feedbacks. In this paper, we propose an incentive system that encourages the buyers to report fair feedbacks. We associate a buyer’s reputation with a seller’s reputation if the buyer has expressed its feedback about the seller. If the reputation of the seller decreases then the reputation of all buyers who had endorsed it (provided positive feedbacks) also decreases and vice versa. This means a buyer risks its own reputation by providing the feedback about a seller. In this paper, we show that such a mechanism is incentive compatible, i.e., it encourages the buyers to provide fair feedbacks. Using analytical and experimental analysis, we show the correctness of this reputation management system.},

To show the fallacy of endogenous discounting, we construct a semantic meta-model that captures the key notions surrounding recommendations.

The evaluation accuracy of seller reputation signiﬁcantly impacts the sellers’ future utility. The existence of unfair ratings is well-recognized to negatively aﬀect the accuracy of reputation evaluation. Most of the existing approaches dealing with unfair ratings focus on ﬁltering/discounting/aligning the possible unfair ratings caused by malicious attacks or subjective diﬀerence. However, these approaches are not eﬀective against unfair ratings in the form of misreporting (e.g., a well-behaving buyer misjudged a seller and provided a negative rating to a transaction which deserves a positive one, and the buyer is willing to revert the misreported negative rating). In this case, how should the buyer undo the damage caused by such misreported ratings and help the seller recover utility loss? In this paper, we propose a reputation revision mechanism to mitigate the negative eﬀects of the misreported ratings. The proposed mechanism temporarily inﬂates the reputation of the misjudged seller for a period of time, which allows the seller to recover his utility loss caused by the misreported ratings. Extensive realistic simulation based experiments demonstrate the necessity and eﬀectiveness of the proposed mechanism.},

A more complex challenge is unpredictable changes that some agents make to their behaviour, which is a cause of performance decrease in trust systems. Many trust models have been developed based on feedback mechanisms, but most of them are unable to detect inaccurate information that a deceptive agent may generate; therefore, the trust systems face diﬃculties in separating the fair from the unfair agents. In this paper, we used learning automata to separate fair from deceptive agents based on an aggregation of their feedback from the votes on each service attribute. The main contribution of this work was a new scheme for separating fair from unfair agents and for estimating the quality of services. We took a more detailed view of service attributes by decomposing a service to its qualitative elements to reach a better match between recommended service characteristics and user preferences. The experimental simulations showed that the new method outperformed other existing models, especially within open environments, in terms of convergence time, accuracy of trust values for unknown agents, user demand modelling, service selection performance and scalability.},

In addition, due to the size of such systems, agents will often interact with other agents with which they have little or no past experience. There is therefore a need to develop a model of trust and reputation that will ensure good interactions among software agents in large scale open systems. Against this background, we have developed TRAVOS (Trust and Reputation model for Agent-based Virtual OrganisationS) which models an agent’s trust in an interaction partner. Speciﬁcally, trust is calculated using probability theory taking account of past interactions between agents, and when there is a lack of personal experience between agents, the model draws upon reputation information gathered from third parties. In this latter case, we pay particular attention to handling the possibility that reputation information may be inaccurate.},

Simple solutions such as exclusively relying on one’s own direct observations have drawbacks, as they do not make use of all the information available. We propose a fully distributed reputation system that can cope with false disseminated information. In our approach, everyone maintains a reputation rating and a trust rating about everyone else that they care about. From time to time ﬁrst-hand reputation information is exchanged with others; using a modiﬁed Bayesian approach we designed and present in this paper, only second-hand reputation information that is not incompatible with the current reputation rating is accepted. Thus, reputation ratings are slightly modiﬁed by accepted information. Trust ratings are updated based on the compatibility of second-hand reputation information with prior reputation ratings. Data is entirely distributed: someone’s reputation and trust is the collection of ratings maintained by others. We enable node redemption and prevent the sudden exploitation of good reputation built over time by introducing re-evaluation and reputation fading. We present the application of our generic reputation system to the context of neighborhood watch in mobile ad-hoc networks, speciﬁcally to the CONFIDANT [3] protocol for the detection and isolation of nodes exhibiting routing or forwarding misbehavior.
